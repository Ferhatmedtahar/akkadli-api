/*
 !CHAPTER 1 : SETTING UP NEST JS

- nest js is a framework for building realable scalable server side applications
- pretty openeniated
- its inspired by google angular framework
- modular architecture and boilerplate code
-- configration , interceptors , exception filters 
-- pipes , decorators , file uploads , ..ect
-- guards , serializers , notifications , ..ect
-- modular code structure that testing is easy 
*/

/**
 - we can use multiple databases and orm's
 nest js is node js frameword that uses typescript to build scalable server side applications
 there are some problems with node js like we dont have architecture and too much flexibility 
 so when we use it alone or with team its easy to understand and manage 
 focuses on the business logic and offer us alot abilities like
 routing ,  middlieware , documentation , exception handling ,testing , plugins 
 WE CAN DO rest api , graphql , cli , web sockets , mvc apps , micro services. 
 */

/*
 install nest js cli command : npm i -g @nestjs/cli 
 
 nest --help
 nest generate --help  to seek help about generate command
 nest new app-name 
 nest build
 nest start 
 nest i
 nest generate ....
 nest add
 
 --dry-run : to see what it will do without actually doing it
 npm run start:dev

 we installed the cli , understood the boilerplate and some commands run the app ,
 
 BEST LEARNING OF NEST is to code a project and then run it
